Here’s a tiny Polytext “program” that computes the factorial of a number and prints the results for 1…5. It uses our core Polytext terms in sequence to form a readable, self-documenting script:

polytext
Copy
Edit
// Define a recursive factorial function
fn factorial param n ->
  // Base case: if n <= 1 return 1
  if n <= 1 return 1

  // Recursive case: return n * factorial(n - 1)
  return n * factorial(n - 1)

// Main routine
fn main ->
  // Create a list of numbers 1 through 5
  var nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

  // For each number in nums, compute and log the factorial
  for num in nums ->
    var result = factorial(num)
    log("factorial of " + num + " is " + result)

// Run the program
main()
Explanation of Polytext terms used:

fn / param / return → function definition, parameters, and return value

if → conditional branch

* / - / <= → arithmetic and comparison

var → mutable variable declaration

[ ] → list constructor

for … in … → loop over a sequence

log → output to console
